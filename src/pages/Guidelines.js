      <p className="general-text">
        In order to contribute, your first step is to fork this project.
        Creating a <a className="special-text">fork</a> will make a copy of this
        project to your GitHub account.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just go to the main page of this project and click the fork button at

      </p>
      <img className="image" className="image" src={Fork}/>
      <h3 className="sub-head1">Step 2: Clone the forked repository to your system</h3>
      <p className="general-text">
        Now you need to clone the forked repository to your system and then all
        the code/docs changes that you'll make, will be in the cloned repository
        only.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li className="general-list">Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, Powershell)</li>
        <li className="general-list">
          Go to the directory where you want to clone your project. For example,
          Let's say you have a folder named as{" "}
          <a className="special-text">opensource</a> at the Desktop where you
          want to clone your project then your command prompt path should look
          like this.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 className="sub-head2">For windows:</h4>
      <p className="code">C:\user\Desktop\opensource></p>

      <p className="code">username's-Mac:~desktop/opensource$</p>
      <h4 className="sub-head2">then write the command given below:</h4>
      <p className="code">git website(text to be added)</p>
      <h4 className="sub-head2">
        then <a>cd</a> to the project by writing
      </h4>
      <p className="code">cd eccentrictouch</p>
      <br />
      <p className="general-text">
        Congratulations! All the setup related things are done now you can go

      <h3 className="sub-head1"> Step 03: Issue related Things</h3>
      <h4 className="sub-head2">If you are Raising an Issue</h4>
      <p className="general-text">
        Raising issues really helps this project to grow more and have great
        usability. There are some type of issues which are listed in the
        screenshot below.
      </p>
      <img className="image" className="image" src={Issue}/>
      <p className="general-text">
        All the issues have pre-designed content template. If you have selected{" "}
        <a className="special-text">Bug Report</a> issue type then precisely
        explain your report or the issue you have faced. Try adding screenshots
        (if possible) for more clarification.
      </p>
      <p className="general-text">
        If you have selected <a className="special-text">Feature Request</a>{" "}
        then explain the feature in description like how it will be implemented,
        why it is required and if you want to work on that issue then write an
        assignment request also that you want to work on it. May be as a comment
        or in the issue itself and we'll get back to your request and start the
        discussion.
      </p>
      <p className="general-text">
        Other than these, you have you have community joining related issue also
        such as<a className="special-text">Community Joining Request</a>
        <a> and Project Maintainer Request</a>
      </p>


      <p className="general-text">
        You can raise an issue in order to join the community on GitHub and
        Discord. We could have directly shared the discord server link with you
        but it has expiry issues. But whenever you'll raise the joining issue,
        our team will get back to you. Also, you can be an active member at The
        DesignSystems Community on GitHub and have a logo under your profile -
        The mark of working/contributing at The DesignSystems projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can raise an issue also to become a Project Maintainer at The
        DesignSystems Community. Just raise your request and we'll get back to
        you and have a discussion. Easy right!?
      </p>
      <h4 className="sub-head2">If you are solving an issue</h4>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3 className="sub-head1">Step 04: Coding, Making the Code Changes</h3>
      If you are doing code changes then make sure that your branch is v2.0 To
      switch from <a className="special-text">master</a> branch to{" "}
      <a className="special-text">v2.0</a>, you need to write.
      <p className="code">git checkout v2.0</p>
      <p className="general-text">
        Time for the real-work, Open your code editor and start working on that
        issue. Thoroughly go to the file structure of the project. When you are
        done with the changes, it's time to create a Pull Request.
      </p>
      <h3 className="sub-head1">Step 05: Creating a Pull Request</h3>
      <p className="general-text">Go to your terminal again, and write the commands mentioned below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li className="general-list"> First you need to add your changes to the Staging area.</li>
        <p className="code">*CHANGES*</p>
        <p className="general-text">If you want to add everything at the time then just write</p>

        <p className="code">git add .</p>
        <p className="general-text">
          But for a good-developer practice always add files according to the
          types of changes made.
        </p>

        <li className="general-list"> Commit your code changes with a short(informative) message</li>

        <p className="code">*CHANGES</p>
        <p className="general-text">
          for an example, you have changed the CSS Properties for the Header and
          the issue-tag was #123 then the proper way to commit your code changes
          would be.
        </p>

        <p className="code">
          git commit -m "CSS Properties for Header changed (#123)"
        </p>
        <p className="general-text">And your changes are committed!</p>
        <li className="general-list"> Push your Code Changes</li>

        <p className="code>">git push -u origin v2.0</p>
        <p className="general-text">
          Make sure that you have done your code changes on the v2.0 branch and
          push on the same branch - The v2.0 branch.
        </p>

        <p className="general-text">
          Voila! Your code changes are pushed to your forked repository. Time to
          create a PR!! ‚≠ê
        </p>
        <li className="general-list">Go to your forked repository</li>
        <p className="general-text">
          When you will go to your forked repository, You will see a
          message/notification like this.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <img className="image" src={Notification}/>
      <p className="general-text">
        Click of the Green Coloured
        <a className="special-text">Compare & Pull Request</a> Button`
      </p>
      <p className="general-text">
        Now after clicking the button you need to write a short but informative
        message in order to support your changes. For example, The one given
        below
      </p>
      <img className="image" src={Message}/>
      <p className="general-text">
        Also, Don't forget to request a review from our project maintainers.
        Select to at least 1-2 project maintainers to review your Pull Request.
        Just like this.
      </p>
      <img className="image" src= {Review}/>
      <p className="general-text">
        All set! Submit your PR. Click the{" "}

      </p>
      <img className="image" src={Submit} />
      <p className="general-text">
        Then wait for the checks, and the discuss the stuff if required with our
        project maintainers and after all the checks we'll merge your Pull
        Request. üòÉ
